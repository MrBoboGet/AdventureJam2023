"I see you can still hold your drink quite well."

"Hmm..."

"I wonder..."

"Careful not to drink too much now."'

"It seems you have still got it."

"It would appear it is your win."

"Hehe, it seems I have still got it."

"Close, but no cigar."

"It would appear it is my win."

"Need another drink, perhaps?"

"Shall we continue?"
