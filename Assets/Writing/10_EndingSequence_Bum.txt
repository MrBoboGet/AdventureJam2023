"Well, wasn't that fun."

"Heh. Sure was, it was a match well fought."

"Maybe, but a win is a win."

"aNd. a. LoSs. iS. A. lOsS...!"

"UUUUUUUUUAAAAARGGH...!!!"

"Umh..."

"But oh well, these things happen."

"Besides, it'd be very unsportsmanlike to not give credit where credit is due."

"So..."

*Clap Clap Clap* 

"Congratulations."

"...Thanks."

"Now then, I *did* promise you some real j u i c y information, didn't I."

The man approaches me quicker than I can react, grabs my hand and presses a folded slip of paper onto my palm. 

"There you go."

"Follow the directions written on there, and I promise you won't be left wanting for fun anytime soon."

Unfolding the paper reveals a number of addresses, along with various names. 

"Hm."

I take out my wallet to put in the paper slip.

"Hm...?"

It's empty. 

I look up, but the man is already gone, without a trace, and without a sound.

"..."

"Heh. Well..."

"Not like it was my money to begin with."

And so, another day passes in the city, where the desires and regrets of people meet and mix in an unending whirlpool of struggle.

Even so, there is a spring to my step as I walk back to my office, my wallet 300 dollasi lighter, and one paper slip heavier.
