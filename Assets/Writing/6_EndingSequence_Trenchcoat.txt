"Huh... Would you look at that."

"G-guess I held back a little too much... A-ahahahaha..."

"It was a close match, but a win is a win."

"O-of course! Yeah, you're weren't half bad!! Hahaha...ha...ha..."

"So, about that information..."

"Oh, yeah, the information! Of course, of course..."

"So, uuh... w-well... Giving you the answer now would be kind of boring, no?!?"

"Umh..."

"SO!!! No need to pay me!!! I'll just give you a hint! Go to Galaxy Gym, you'll find your next lead there! Promise!"

"...Huh"

"So yeah, that's that! See you around, pal!"

The man storms out of the bar, a busy man indeed.

I bid my friend farewell, and begin to search for the aformentioned Galaxy Gym...
