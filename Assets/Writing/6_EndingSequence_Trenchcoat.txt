"Huh... Would you look at that."

"G-guess I held back a little too much... A-ahahahaha..."

"It was a close match, but a win is a win."

"O-of course! Yeah, you're weren't half bad!! Hahaha...ha...ha..."

"So, about that information."

"Oh, yeah, the information! Of course, of course..."

"..."

"So, uuh... w-well... I've been thinking, and..."

"...Giving you the entire answer now would boring, right!!?"

"Uhm..."

"Take it from me, life needs suspence! And nothing beats the gratification of your own effort! Just like solving a hard puzzle, yeah!?"

"SO!!! No need to pay me!!! Instead, I'll just give you a hint!"

"Go to Galaxy Gym, you'll find your next lead there! I Promise!!"

"...Huh."

"So yeah, that's that! See you around, pal!"

Barely having finished his sentence, the man storms out of the bar, what a busy life he seems to live.

Although a bit different from how it was meant to play out, it's not like I didn't get *nothing* out of our encounter.

All in all, no harm was done, and I got a lead. Unexpected turns of this caliber is nothing in this line of work.

Having finished my business here, I rise from my seat to bid my friend farewell, and to begin my search for the gym.

"Oh?"

"It seems our friend forgot to pay for his drinks."

"..."

"Let us see..." 

"Oh, would you look at that. The bill comes to a neat 150 dollasi."

"..."

I silently put the money I won from the man in the trenchcoat on the counter.

...Not like it was my money to begin with.

"Here, for his drinks."

In the end, I guess I paid for the information anyway.

"Oh, how kind of you."

"Heh, I can afford the kindness to pay for a stranger's drink every once in a while, don't you agree?"

"Mmm, yes, that is very like you."

"Well then, on account of your good deed I suppose I shall let you add the cost of your own drinks to your previous tab."

"..."

"...I'll be back."

Pulling my hat down over my face and walking out into the streets, I silently swear to myself that my next visit will be when I pay for my tab.
