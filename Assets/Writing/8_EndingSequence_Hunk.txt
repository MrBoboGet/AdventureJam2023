"Phew! That was fun! And a good workout too!"

"Yeah, you tell me."

"I can tell, you have some serious macho potential, come back whenever you want to workout, I'll be here!"

"Of course, I'll be back"

It feels like I've forgotten something in the process of lifting weights and playing cards...

"Guess it can't have been too important."

Exhausted, but satisfied, I make my way onto the streets of the city once more.
