"Phew! You got me good!"

"But still, that was fun! And a good workout too!"

Wiping away the sweat from his forehead, the man extends his hand towards me with a refreshed smile on his face. 

"Haah... Haah... It... Haah... Sure was..."

Just from looking, you wouldn't think me the winner of our duel. Reaching out with my shaking hand, I grab his in a firm handshake.

"I can tell, you have some serious macho potential!" 

"Come back whenever you feel like it, I'll be here!"

Exhausted as I am, I can't deny the fun this duel brought.

"Haah... Heh... Haah... Of course, I'll be back... Haah..."

Catching my breath, I turn around to leave the gym.

"Oh! And don't forget to pay the gym fee of 150 dollasi on your way out!"

"...Right."

Descending the stairs, I walk up to the receptionist and pay the fee.

...Not like it was my money to begin with.

I leave the gym and make my way onto the streets of this city once more.

Though physically exhausted from the intense workout, my spirit still hungers for the thrill of the next duel. 

I let my feet carry me forward while I ponder where to go next.

It feels as though I've forgotten something in the process of lifting weights and playing cards...

...But I'm sure it will come back to me if it's truly important.
