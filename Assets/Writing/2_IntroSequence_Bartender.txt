Pushing open a pair of wooden doors I step over the doorstep, revealing the dimly lit insides of a classy, but not gaudy, bar.

"Oh? Why hello there." 

"It has been a while since last time, has it not?"

I am greeted by a man standing behind the counter, the owner of the bar, and an old friend.

As I take a seat by the counter I notice that there is another customer besides me, even though it's still early in the morning.

After a quick glance I turn my attention back towards my friend.

"I've been meaning to stop by, but ironically all the free time I've had recently has left me idling my time away instead."

"Hm, yes, I must confess it is not too hard to imagine that happening to you."

With our greetings out of the way, I show him the paper slip I received from my client.

"Does anything written here ring any bells?"

He spends a moment reading the contents on the paper before squinting his eyes.

"Hm? No, unfortunately I cannot say it does. Is it some form of riddle? Or perhaps a code of some sort?"

"No idea, a client gave it to me, but said nothing else afterwards."

"Well, it certainly seems like you have your work cut out for you, then."

"..."

"With that said, I may or may not know someone else that you could ask."

"Oh yeah?"

"Of course, it *has* been quite some time since we last got to see each other. Cutting our reunion short would be quite a pity, so what say you about a game of cards while we talk?"

"Ho? And I assume I'm not leaving with that information unless I beat you first, then?"

"Hehe, that is so."

"Heh, sure, lets play. It's only fair."

"Oh! And I am only asking to be sure, but..."

"Hm?"

"...You *do* remember the rules for playing, I hope?"

"...Of course I do."

"..."

"..."

"...I see. Then I suppose I shall give you a brief refresher on the rules before we begin."

"...One shot of the usual, please"

"Coming up."
