Walking past an alleyway I hear a voice calling out to me.

"Hey, you there. Yes, you."

"...You need anything?"

A man dressed in rags emerges from the darkness of the alleyway.

"I can tell by the look on your face, you're starting to get hungry, hungry for an opponent, that is."

"I also happen to be hungry..." 

"Hungry for some food, that is."

"..."

"I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse... Or, something else..."

"...If you're looking for food, you're better off going to a soup kitchen."

As I begin to walk away the man grabs me by my shoulder.

"Now, now. Don't be like that."

I try to swat away his hand... But his appearance belies the iron grip he has on my shoulder.

"You know, I'm something of a *card player* myself."

"Duel me, and I promise your hunger will be sated." 

"..."

"Win, and I'll tell you where to find other *worthy* opponents."

"Lose, and I'll be *feasting* like a king, on your dime, naturally."

"...Heh."

"Interesting."

"Let's see what you've got then."

The man's face is split by a massive grin.
