Walking past an alleyway I hear a voice calling out to me.

"Hey, you there. Yes, you."

"...You need anything?"

A man dressed in rags emerges from the darkness of the alleyway.

"I can tell by the look on your face, you're starting to get hungry, hungry for an opponent, that is."

"I also happen to be hungry..." 

"Hungry for some food, that is."

"..."

"I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse..." 

"Or, something else..." The man says while looking me straight in the eyes, simultaneously wiping away some drool from his mouth. 

"...If you're looking for food, you're better off going to a soup kitchen."

Feeling a slight shiver up my spine, I try to walk away, but am stopped by the man who grabs me by my shoulder.

"Now, now. Don't be like that."

I try to move away his hand, but to no avail. His frail appearance belies the iron grip he has on my shoulder.

"You know, I'm something of a *card player* myself."

"And I can tell you're hungry as well." 

"Hungry for worthy opponents, that is."

"..."

"Lose, and I'll be... Sating my needs, on your dime, naturally."

"But win... And I'll give you the information you want the most."

For a moment I stop to think, but in my heart, I know there is only one answer I can give.

"...Heh."

"Interesting."

"Let's see what you've got then."

"Hehe~, G R E A T~."

The man's face is split by a massive grin.
