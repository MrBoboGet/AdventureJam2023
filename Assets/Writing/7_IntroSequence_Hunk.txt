After asking around, and a lengthy walk, I finally arrive before a large building, with a logo of a galaxy flexing its biceps on top of its roof.

I pay the membership fee for a day before making my way up the stairs.

A sea of muscles and sweat expand before my eyes.

"Oof, those muscles..."

After barely managing to hold onto my sanity I begin to scan the room for anything that could give me a lead. 

That's when I see it. In the far end of the room stands a hulking figure. Even in the midst of this sea of muscles, this person stands heads and shoulders above the rest.

I feel that this must be the man I was hinted to look for.

"Excuse me, do you have a moment?"

"Huh? Oh? Can I help you?"

"Well, actually..."

I explain the circumstances to the man.

"Hmmmm... Sounds really mysterious, huh!"

"I can't remember anything of the top of my head, but maybe if I lift some weights I'll remember something?"

"Sure, why not."

"..."

"Want to play a game of cards too?"

"Sure!"
