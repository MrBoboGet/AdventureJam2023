After asking around, and a lengthy walk, I finally arrive before a large building, with a logo of a galaxy flexing its biceps on top of its roof.

Entering the building, I am met with a reception desk and a pair of stairs leading to an upper floor.

Blending in with the rest of the gym-goers, I slip past the reception desk and ascend the stairs. 

Arriving on the next floor, a sea of bulging muscles expand before my eyes.

"Oof, those muscles..."

After barely managing to hold onto my sanity, I begin to scan the room for anything, or anyone, that could give me a lead. 

That's when I see it. In the far end of the room stands a hulking figure. Even in the midst of this sea of muscle, he stands heads and shoulders above the rest.

Inexplicably drawn in by his gravitational pull, I cannot help but feel this man is what I was sent here to look for.

"Excuse me, do you have a moment?"

"Huh? Me? Umh, sure! How can I help you?"

"Well, actually..."

I explain the circumstances to the man.

"Hmmmm! Really mysterious, huh!"

"Can't say it rings any bells, but maybe if I lift some weights I'll remember something?"

"Sure, why not."

Watching the man begin lifting weights of impossible size I stay silent for a while, but eventually decide to join him, although with smaller weights.

"...Want to play a game of cards too while we're at it?"

"...? Sure, why not!"
